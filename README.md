### For the developers - If you want to use this repo, here is the steps - 


#### Getting Started with Cloning the Repo

1. Download the zip file.
2. Open it in your VS code. 
3. Split the terminal. In one side write - 

``` cd backend ```

4. In the other side write - 

```cd frontend```

5. In both the side install npm. (Make sure you have downloaded Node)

```npm i```

6. You need to add `.env` file. Create your own `.env` file for both backend and frontend, where you have to connect mongodb, firebase, razorpay ids and all..
7. Run `npm start` in the backend terminal, and `npm run dev` in the frontend terminal.
